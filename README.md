<p>My name is Denis. I am game developer, who loves games! (^o-o^) 
I am working on Unity3D / Godot Engine and I love to create game mechanics and UI - everything that players interact with directly. My dream is to work on a game that will bring warm emotions and a sense of freedom to the players who will play it! :)</p>

‚ú® I'm a frontend engineer and technical writer passionate about making the web accessible to everyone and advocating for building open and inclusive developer communities. 

I love sharing my knowledge with others, and I do that through content creation on my Blog and YouTube channel. I'm a GitHub Star, Media Developer Expert at Cloudinary, an Auth0 Ambassador, and Nuxt.js Ambassador. When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking about photography and exploring different ways of documenting stories using photography.
